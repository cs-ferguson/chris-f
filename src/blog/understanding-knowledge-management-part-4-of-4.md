# Understanding Knowledge Management — Part 4/4

Institutionalised Myths and Recommendations
> …Knowledge Management, like so many aspects of management, has noble aims but suffers from drastic simplification.

If you skipped to the last part, I’ll quickly sum up parts 1 to 3…

* Knowledge doesn’t exist — it is a term that requires a certainty and objectivity that is close to impossible. It is best to think of human sense-making as unique, and based on the influence of our previous experiences and external influences (socio-political).

* Knowledge Management developed without a full understanding of what knowledge is — it was just accepted unquestioningly as a valuable resource. The goal of knowledge management appears to be the efficient and timely sharing and creation of knowledge, which is impossible.

* It is more useful to think of knowledge in terms of information — which can be disseminated but not shared — and skills, which can be taught/learned — the definition of both of these does admittedly also need work.

* Teaching skills can be seen to rely on increased media-richness, and efficient feedback. This would make teaching in person, by imitation and with lots of practice the best way to not only teach skills, but disseminate information as it would reduce misinterpretation and confirm understanding.

* Despite this, it is a highly inefficient method, and the level of uncertainty reduction may vary in importance — humans have managed to acquire skills and disseminate information successfully via unresponsive media (books, audio/ video recordings) for a long time.

* It was therefore suggested that any requirements of information dissemination/skill acquisition are assessed on a sufficiency/efficiency basis: sufficiency being the complexity of the task and the subsequent media-richness required, and efficiency the time/cost available and number of people who need the info/skill.

This part utilises this reinterpretation and analyses the implications, supported by empirical evidence gathered in focus groups at my place of work.

## **Discussion**

### **We already understand that we have it wrong…**

It was easy in the focus groups to show the uncertainty that undermines knowing, and to gather evidence of previous experiences determining behaviour. It was very interesting to find however, that most people possess a tacit understanding of these issues: interactions displayed attempts at clarifying terms, attempts at refining understanding, and recognition that an increase in information will lessen the chance of misinterpretation. It seems humans may have evolved to recognise the uncertainty behind their understandings, or at least recognise situations where rigorous analysis of their beliefs is required. This is not all that surprising; the relative success of human endeavour and our ability to exchange ideas on a wide scale suggests the effects of misinterpretation on the whole may actually be negligible.

Despite support for the dismissal of knowledge and its reinterpretation in terms of information and skill — this is not the main point to take away from this exploration. Accepting the reinterpretation leads to more important implications…

### **The importance of proximity…**

In an environment such as a workplace, where the receipt of information is important, or where a skill is being learned, we have suggested the importance of an increase in information, ideally delivered through a variety of media (media-richness theory). The importance of timely feedback has also been mentioned as significant. This has spatial implications, suggesting the importance of proximity, (whether this is spatial in a geographical sense, or a philosophical sense is cause for a separate exploration) where people working in close proximity leads to an increase of media-richness and feedback (again, humans may already be tacitly aware of this — [a study by Akgun et al. suggests a general preference for face-to-face exchange](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1580897&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1580897)).

It is also thought that the sharing of space, particularly over a period of time, will also improve a group’s ability to communicate — in Heidegerrian terms they will share language and experiences that will increase similarities in the way information is interpreted. This building of shared experiences suggests a temporal aspect, which highlights a major problem with Knowledge Management in Project teams — in projects there is little time available to build relationships, and few permanent working relationships.

The above addresses day-to-day, untargeted information gathering, but what about deliberate dissemination of information — what methods should be chosen? We have already considered the fact that face-to-face is not always possible, and this led to the suggestion of an assessment against sufficiency/efficiency requirements. When we analyse existing practices in this way, we can already see some mistakes we are making…

### **Methods That Don’t Make Sense…**

The process of “codification” is often referred to in Knowledge Management literature — in the literature it refers to ‘transferring knowledge’ into a physical medium, such as writing an instruction manual, or creating a report. Epistemological issues aside, [Boisot](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6486.1983.tb00203.x/abstract) astutely described codification as “an exercise in abstraction which can offer us considerable mental economies”; this echoes what has been said above, that although this simplification of information increases the chances of misinterpretation, it can be distributed easily to a large number of people. The problem with codification is that it is used in the wrong scenarios.

In my current industry of Engineering, codification is the prevalent method in delivering information on organizational processes and procedures; things that cannot be fully understood without the performance of these tasks. The main problem is that people are expected to perform their tasks in accordance with these rules, and to follow them, not only must they be read, but they must be read repeatedly and in conjunction with the performance of the task. Interestingly, in the focus groups performed, participants were aware of the unsuitability of codification methods, proposing alternatives ranging from video presentations (a basic increase in media-richness) to one-on-one teaching (a large increase in media-richness).

So why has codification prevailed? Well, sticking to the Engineering example, written procedures are required for Quality accreditations such as ISO9001, which in turn is looked favourably upon by prospective clients. This is a reflection of [Meyer and Rowan’s](http://faculty.washington.edu/jwilker/571/571readings/MeyerRowan.pdf) compelling argument that “institutional rules” emerge from myth-like functions that become to be perceived as required and rational — when often they are anything but. However organisations that stick to these rules gain legitimacy, and increase their chances of survival. If these functions are ignored, organisations could face accusations of irrationality or negligence. Codification in this case is inefficient, but has been adopted as a sign of competence — its adoption has made it a necessary evil. This adds further complexity to assessing what methods to use in achieving our goals — not only must we consider sufficiency/efficiency, but we must consider what is required to maintain legitimacy — even if it doesn’t make sense!

In the focus groups, these myth-like functions clearly influenced chosen methods of dissemination/teaching, but there were other influences that showed up: participants often limited there choice of methods based on assumptions of time/cost constraints that did not exist!
> **It seems that if we are successfully meet the goals that Knowledge Management set out to achieve, we must recognise not only our misunderstanding of what knowledge is, but that our chosen methods are mired in assumptions and irrationalities arising from our circumstances.**

## **Conclusions/Recommendations**

* **We should stop thinking in terms of knowledge — but think of information and skills. We want project teams that are informed, in conjunction with possessing the required skills.**

* **Proximity is vital for creating a team that is informed due to an increased amount of information/maximisation of media. This will also increase shared understandings and reduce misinterpretation. Temporality is important for this, but is a problem in Project Teams where this often little time or permanence of relationships.**

* **Any targeted information dissemination/skill teaching should be considered in terms of sufficiency (complexity requires more information/media) and efficiency (cost available and amount of people to inform/teach).**

* **Any current Knowledge Management processes should be looked at to see if they make sense in these terms, or whether they are an institutional requirement.**

This is a massive subject that has been difficult to fit into 4 lengthy parts. Putting this into any sort of concise nature is impossible because Knowledge Management, like so many aspects of management, has noble aims but suffers from drastic simplification. Answering the questions Knowledge Management literature asks requires the admission that it is inextricably linked to complex aspects of being/society/culture. Only by looking at these can we begin to understand how to work together with more success.
