# Understanding Knowledge Management — Part 3/4

Information and Media-Richness

o far, this series has established what knowledge is not, and has analysed the historical progression of Knowledge Management as a discipline. It was suggested in [Part 2](http://www.chris-f.com/post/74265930755/understanding-knowledge-management) that Information may be a more suitable term to use instead of Knowledge, as its objectivity makes it possible to exist separate to a being, and that Information Management’s rejection due to its lack of consideration of subjective matters was the wrong direction to take.

This post will start by further assessing the differences between ‘Information’ and ‘Knowledge’, and will then proceed to reinterpret the Knowledge Management goal of “knowledge” transfer in terms of information — tackling know-what (as information) and know-how (as skills) separately.

## **Information**

For the purposes of this exploration, Information is to be considered as something purely objective that can be interpreted or made sense of. There are numerous models, including the popular [hierarchical view of knowledge, information and data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_Pyramid), where information is classed as data put into some sort of structure — this is seen here as incorrect as this instantly makes information subjective. Here, information and data could be considered as one and the same.

Despite its objective nature, information still cannot be ‘shared’ — this sharing goal of Knowledge Management is simply a lazy metaphor that fails to describe what is really happening. Information can be produced by one being, and this information is interpreted by another being, but for interpretation to be shared is reliant on these two beings sharing previous understandings, which cannot be guaranteed.

This inability to share seems counter-intuitive. If we cannot share or exchange knowledge *or *information, how have we ever taught each other skills?

## **Teaching and Learning Skills — Media Richness, Feedback and why practice is always best**

Media (or Information) Richness is a concept developed by Daft and Lengel in the context of information processing within an organisation. Daft and Lengel originally used it to describe the ability of a medium to reproduce the information sent over it — a medium is richer if it can convey different types of information. For example a phone conversation is not as rich as a face-to-face conversation due to an inability to convey physical gestures, and reduced sound quality. Bearing this in mind, it is easy to imagine why I would propose that teaching a skill will be more efficient the richer the medium. Imagine trying to teach someone to ride a bike over the phone instead of being there with them.

There is another important aspect to learning that should not be forgotten, and that is feedback. The medium of feedback benefits from being richer, but also benefits from speed — the more responsive the feedback, the more efficient the learning process will be. Feedback comes not only from external observers, but also internally, by responding to the results of performing (or attempting to perform) a skill.

Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus have produced a rather satisfying [description of skill acquisition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) that details development from Novice to Expert. Their description marks skill acquisition as dependent heavily on situational experience — the Novice performs based on the conscious application of external rules, whereas the transition to expert involves the recognition of situations derived from previous experiences to decide which action to take in order to perform the skill. The “expert performer” can act and learn unconsciously. So not only can the mental processes of the expert never be articulated, they are also grounded in their own understandings and are completely personal (Polanyi had similar views described in his process of ‘**in-dwelling**’).

Teaching/learning skills can then be seen as improved by increased media-richness and speedier feedback. By practicing a skill you are offered instant feedback, and a chance to experience and *dwell in *situations for future (albeit mostly subconscious) reference.

## **Reinterpreting ‘Knowledge Management’**

Taking what has been previously discussed into account, it would make sense to propose that Knowledge Management’s goals are reinterpreted to the efficient production and dissemination of information, and the efficient teaching of relevant skills. This separation of information and skills is immensely important as it highlights the completely different natures of the two — something that has previously been ignored, or interpreted incorrectly (tacit/explicit is not a dichotomy) in Knowledge Management literature.

This reinterpretation allows a clearer view of how we can begin to successfully achieve the goals above. For Information dissemination, traditional Information Management focusses such as availability and accessibility become important. But information benefits from being in a diverse range of media, **and it should be remembered that talking produces information. **Whatever the media staff need to know where, and when, to look for information — **which is a skill. **From what has been proposed about skills, it would appear the most efficient method of teaching and learning is practice in the supervising presence of an experienced practitioner. However, consider if this method was used to teach everyone in the company how to open an e-mail, and we see why teaching in this way is limited by time.

If this level of media-richness, practice and supervision were required to transfer all skills, then human science and technology would never have progressed as rapidly as it has. Transfer of skills requires an assessment of the method used on a scale of sufficiency vs. efficiency: sufficiency of information/media against the time/cost available and amount of people that require the skill. Interestingly, the analysis work I performed for my thesis suggested that we already preform this assessment, at least subconsciously. Lest we forget, learning and teaching are skills in themselves!

What was also apparent form my analysis, was that we are also tacitly aware of the uncertainty that accompanies ‘knowing’, and are aware of situations where our understandings and previous experiences may differ, and seek to clarify terms. Does this make a reinterpretation of ‘Knowledge’ pointless? Does it make it purely a nit-picking of terms, an over-analysis of language? No, as the reinterpretation has allowed us to really explore *why *certain techniques are more successful, improving our **understanding **of *when *and *how *we should use them. It also allows us to address what is going wrong in unsuccessful implementations, and when the use of certain techniques *just doesn’t make sense. *This will be looked at in the [final part](https://medium.com/p/547459b5d597).
